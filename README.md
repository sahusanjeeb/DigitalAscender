# UI Boilerplate

This is a boilerplate code to start a new Enterprise Angular application.

The boilerplate is setup with the following to Jump start your project:

-   Prettier - Code Formatter
-   ESLint - Recommended Linting tool
-   COMPODOC - Auto Documentation
-   Source Map Explorer - Analyze yor code

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## COMPODOC Documentation

Run `npm install -g @compodoc/compodoc`

Run `compodoc -p tsconfig.doc.json -s`

Access the documentation at `http://localhost:8080/`.

## Linting with ESLint

Run `ng lint`.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
